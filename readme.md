<h1>Pressure-Based Compliance Assurance System</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>If wheelchair-bound patients sit too long, they will develop sores.
To prevent this, the patient must periodically relieve pressure on body parts touching the wheelchair by lifting or shifting from side to side.
This system is designed to ensure that the patient is relieving pressure as prescribed.</p>
