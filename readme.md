<h1>Pressure-Based Compliance Assurance System</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>If wheelchair-bound patients sit too long, they will develop sores.
To prevent this, the patient must periodically relieve pressure on body parts touching the wheelchair by lifting or shifting from side to side.
This system is designed to ensure that the patient is relieving pressure as prescribed.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The software given is written for Arduino IDE. An SSD1306 based OLED display and an SD card share the SPI bus, and six force-sensitive resistors are used in a voltage divider (and read by A0..A5) to obtain pressure readings in relevant locations. </p>
